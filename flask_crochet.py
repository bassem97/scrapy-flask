"""
If Twisted's WSGI server is not desired in favor for solutions like uwsgi or gunicorn or anything similar,
the `crochet` library can execute Twisted code in an isolated thread. Be EXTREMELY careful with this solution!
Python's WSGI servers generally use threads, as does `crochet`, and/or processes which means there might be
situations where one thread may spawn multiple threads. It's up to the developers to account for intricacies
hen dealing with multi threaded/process applications.

Local usage:

    python flask_crochet.py

Gunicorn usage:

    gunicorn -b 0.0.0.0:9000 flask_crochet:app
